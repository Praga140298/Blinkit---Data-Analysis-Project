This repository showcases a Power BI Dashboard analyzing Uttering Threat (UT) crime trends across Canadian provinces—focusing on Alberta (AB), Manitoba (MB), and Ontario (ON)—with deep dives into age-based crime rates, forecasting, and regional hot spots.

**Objective**

To explore 10+ years of UT crime data and:

Identify trends and shifts in crime patterns

Compare youth vs adult crime rates

Forecast future incidents

Pinpoint high-crime regions

Support data-driven crime prevention policies

**Key Visuals & Insights**

**Section	Description**

UT Crime -                      Forecast	A line forecast with confidence intervals predicting a decline from 20.5K in 2023 to ~15K by 2026

Adult Rate vs Youth Rate -      A scatter plot showing a positive correlation between adult and youth crime rates across cities (e.g., Grande Prairie, Calgary)

Top 5 Cities by Crime Rate -    A donut chart revealing that 5 cities in Alberta account for a significant share of UT incidents, with the top city alone at 41.56%

Crime Incidents –               10-Year Trend	A historical line chart showing a steady decline in incidents—from 20.5K (2013) to 15K (2023)

Rate of AVG Crime Occurrence -  A downward trend in average crime rate: from 71K in 2022 to 49K in 2018, showing systemic improvement

**Insights & Takeaways**

Crime incidents are decreasing, but certain regions still report disproportionately high UT cases.

Adult and youth rates are closely linked, indicating early interventions may lower adult crime rates.

Alberta cities dominate the top 5—suggesting the need for regional policing focus or community outreach.

Forecasting tools predict continued decline, but emphasize the importance of proactive measures.
